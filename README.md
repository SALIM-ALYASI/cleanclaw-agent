# CleanClaw Agent 🧹🦾

A safety-first local organizer that scans your Home folder, classifies clutter, and moves files into a structured “PARKING” system — **no automatic deletion**.

## Core Principles
- **Safety First:** no direct deletion (only moves to `DELETE_QUEUE/`)
- **Dry-Run first:** preview actions before executing
- **Project Protection:** exclude important project folders
- **Never overwrite:** conflicts get timestamped rename
- **Clear reports:** Markdown report for every run
